### Summary

*   Development Status: beta-0.9.6  

*   Environment: Win32 (MS Windows 2000/XP)  

*   Intended Audience: Epidemiologists, geneticists  

*   Operating System: MS Windows 2000 & XP  

*   Programming Language: Fortran 90  

*   Topic: Statistical genetics  

### Description of project:

Scout is a software program for conducting combined association analysis of triads and unrelated subjects. The software utilizes statistical methodology developed in Epstein et al. (2005).  

The downloaded file will contain both a command line version and a GUI version. Both versions use the SCOUT.dll file included in the distribution. Also, the current documentation was written for the command line version only; however, an update including the GUI version documentation is forthcoming.
